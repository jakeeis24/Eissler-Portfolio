# Eissler-Portfolio

# Updated 03/02/22

I updated my portfolio to include links in the contact card to to all of my pertinent contact information. I removed all the links to third party websites that were ultimately serving as just test links to verify I had everything working properly.

3 new cards were added which include my first project and two bootcamp assigments that I think went really well. The cards have screenshots of the applications along with links to the deployed apps and links to the repositories.

With the knowledge I now have, I am not a big fan of the current layout of my portfolio. The initial page was created prior to having knowledge of bootstrap and JavaScript, so I am thinking of making a new portfolio page which will be much more interactive and user friendly (not to mention much prettier), especially on mobile. When that happens, I will keep this portfolio alive just to showcase my progress, but I will include a link in this readme to the new portfolio and I will make sure it does not get missed.

It is wild to think about how much I have learned in the past month. The grind is real and I cannot wait to see where I go with this portfolio!

# Version 1.0 (February 2022)

In this repository you will find the beginning code base for my professional portfolio. I am very excited about it as I know it will only get better with time! My portfolio is in the very early stages of development because I do not have any projects to add to it yet.

The links in the nav bar will navigate the user to the respective cards on the page. Each card has been set up to direct the user to other pages (info about me, my projects, contact info) but the links currently go to other sites because we have not created any other pages yet.

I decided to structure the page in a card style because I thought it looked very professional for a portfolio-style page. The cards also worked very well in terms of responsiveness with CSS flex-boxes, which are implemented in the page. Along with the flex-box properties, the cards responded well to different user interfaces through the use of media queries. The hover pseudoclass is applied to all of the links in the page giving the user more interactiveness on the page.

This initial portfolio building project has taught me that the possibilities are truly endless with just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. I am very excited to be able to make this page even more responsive and user friendly as my knowledge-base grows throughout the bootcamp! I cannot wait to be able to tell a potential employer down the road that I began this project after only one week of coding!
